**Overview:**
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon musical product reviews. Using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the goal is to classify customer reviews as positive or negative based on textual data.

**Features:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization of text data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing word frequencies, sentiment distributions, and feature correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and deep learning models (LSTM).
5. **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**Project Work-Flow:**

1. **Data Collection**: Load and clean the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Remove stopwords, tokenize, lemmatize, and vectorize text.
3. **EDA**: Generate word clouds, sentiment distributions, and feature correlations.
4. **Modeling**: Train machine learning models and deep learning models for sentiment classification.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare model performances and select the best-performing model.

**Conclusion :**

Best-performing model achieved an **F1-score of 89%**. Identified key words influencing sentiment classification. Provided insights into customer opinions on musical products.
